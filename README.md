# small-office-home-office-SOHO-
This SOHO network uses one switch and one router with four PCs divided into two VLANs. PC1 and PC3 are in VLAN 10, while PC2 and PC4 are in VLAN 20. The switch separates traffic, and the router enables inter-VLAN communication, improving security and performance in a small network.
